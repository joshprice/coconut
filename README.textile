Coconut is a *jQuery plugin* designed to simplify working with complex forms. It provides an *Object-Oriented* encapsulation of forms and their field groups using a straighforward declarative syntax. It enables some very powerful ways for decomposing forms into conceptual parts, and provides meaningful abstractions for these parts.

h3. Build a Part

Given partial page as below:

<pre>
  <div id="person">
      <input type="text" name="name" value="luning"/>
      <select name="title">
          <option>Mr</option>
          <option>Mrs</option>
      </select>
  </div>
</pre>

Then:

<pre>
  var person = $("#person").part();
</pre>

Will build a *part* representing person with all *field*s set up automatically, you can do:

h3. State and Field Operations

<pre>
  var theName = person.name.state();
</pre>

_theName_ is _"luning"_. _name_ is one field of person, _state()_ will return value of the field, similar as _val()_ on jQuery object.

<pre>
  person.name.state("smith");
</pre>

Set state of _name_ field to new value, similar as _val("smith")_ on jQuery but with proper events fired as what happens in real user interactions.

<pre>
  var theState = person.state();
</pre>

_theState_ is an object _{ name: "smith", title: "Mr" }_, this is the current state of the part.

<pre>
  person.state( {name: "jessie", title: "Mrs"} );
</pre>

Set new state of person part, with events(e.g. change, blur) fired, which will trigger proper handlers.

<pre>
  var dirty = person.isDirty();
</pre>

_dirty_ is _true_, since the state of person is changed after initialization.

<pre>
  person.resetState();
</pre>

Set state back to the initial one _{ name: "luning", title: "Mr" }_.

h3. Binding and Event Operations

<pre>
  person.name.bindState("#id_of_a_label");
</pre>

Any change of name will update the value of target label specified by jQuery selector.

<pre>
  person.bindState("#id_of_summary_span", function(s){
      return "summary: " + s.title + " " + s.name + " (" + s.gender + ")";
  });
</pre>

Any field change in person will update the summary span by applying a converter function.

<pre>
  person.name.change(function(){ /* custom logic */});
  person.change(function(){ /* custom logic */});
</pre>

Change of field or person part will trigger custom handlers.

h3. Mixin Behaviors

You can extend part by mixing in behavior(s).

<pre>
  function Person(){
      this.summary = function(){
          var s = this.state();
          return s.title + " " + s.name + " (" + s.gender + ")";
      }
  }

  var person = $("#person").part(Person);
  var summary = person.summary();
</pre>

Define behavior _Person_ as a function, build part with the behavior, and _summary()_ method is mixed into the part.

_**Behavior is actually the place you should arrange custom client side logic about person part.**_

You can also specify the behavior(function) in Dom element by setting the custom _part_ property:

<pre>
  <div id="person" part="Person">
    ...
  </div>
</pre>

Then:

<pre>
  var person = $("#person").part();
  var summary = person.summary();
</pre>

Coconut will pick the behavior up and apply it for you automatically.

h3. Build a Composite Part

You are allowed to build a composite part with another part as field by setting up _part_ property on any Dom element which can be used as a container.

With this Dom:

<pre>
  <div id="person">
    ...
    <div part="" name="contact">
      <input type="text" name="number"/>
      <input type="text" name="type"/>
    </div>
  </div>
</pre>

Then:

<pre>
  var person = $("#person").part();
  
  var personState = person.state();
  var contactState = person.contact.state();
  var numberState = person.contact.number.state();
</pre>

_personState_ is _{ name: "luning", title: "Mr", contact: {number: "", type: ""} }_.

_contactState_ is _{number: "", type: ""}_.

_numberState_ is _""_.

Build a part with a field containing an array of sub-fields with the same name (e.g. person may have multiple emails) by setting _fieldtype_ property to _array_ on Dom element.

With this Dom:

<pre>
  <div id="person">
    ...
    <input type="text" fieldtype="array" value="a@my.com" name="email"/>
    <input type="text" value="b@my.com" name="email"/>
  </div>
</pre>

Then:

<pre>
  var person = $("#person").part();

  var personState = person.state();
  var emailsState = person.emails.state();
  var firstEmailState = person.emails[0].state();
</pre>

_personState_ is _{ name: "", title: "Mr", emails: ["a@my.com", "b@my.com"] }_.

_emailsState_ is _["a@my.com", "b@my.com"]_.

_firstEmailState_ is _"a@my.com"_.

h3. Dynamic Behavior (Sync Between Dom and Part)

Adding Dom element(s) dynamically will add corresponding field(s) as well, any event registered on part works for the newly added field(s).

Given two emails in Dom already, then:

<pre>
  var person = $("#person").part();

  var newEmail = $("<input type="text" name="email"></input>");
  person.container.append(newEmail);
  newEmail.sync();

  var emailCount = person.emails.length;
</pre>

_emailCount_ is _3_, reflects the added email. 

Coconut extends jQuery with _sync()_ method, call it after Dom is added.

The same thing happens when removing Dom element(s) from Dom, field(s) will be removed.

Given two emails in Dom already, then:

<pre>
  var person = $("#person").part();

  person.container.find("input[name=email]:last").remove();
  person.sync();

  var emailCount = person.emails.length;
</pre>

_emailCount_ is _1_, reflects the removal.

Call _sync()_ on part after removing Dom.
