TODO

[ ] update documentation according to recent changes
[ ] build parcel with multiple behaviours
[ ]?? set state will remove item from array parcel if needed
[ ] support setting state with ajax call(introduce WaitThread and countOfActiveAjaxRequest)
[ ] turn off animation while setting state
[ ] use smoke mocks rather than roll our own
[ ] consider renaming initialState() => initial or pristine?, resetState() => reset or revert, captureState() => save. 4 actions: get the last saved state, reset to blank, revert to the last saved state, save state.
[ ] support textarea, multi-select and select-one
[ ] make show/hide speed configurable

potential problems:
[ ] remove a DOM with many fields will fire change event multiple times unexpectedly, once on each field's closest alive original parent.
