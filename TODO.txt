TODO

[ ] update documentation according to recent changes
[ ] use smoke mocks rather than roll our own
[ ] consider renaming initialState() => initial or pristine?, resetState() => reset or revert, captureState() => save. 4 actions: get the last saved state, reset to blank, revert to the last saved state, save state.
[*] make part a jquery object
[*] dynamiclly adding/removing DOM should fire change event
[*] merge part and fieldtype property in DOM
[*] consider merge part with array field, share implementation
[*] specify array fieldtype on container rather than on elements
[ ] build part with state
[ ] work with hidden template for array type field
[ ] add behaviour with parameters
[ ] jQuery object out of the scope of all parts may listen to state change of below parts some how


potential problems:
[ ] remove a DOM with many fields will fire change event multiple times unexpectedly, once on each field's closest alive original parent.
