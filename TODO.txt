TODO

[ ] use smoke mocks rather than roll our own
[ ] consider renaming initialState() => initial or pristine?, resetState() => reset or revert, captureState() => save. 4 actions: get the last saved state, reset to blank, revert to the last saved state, save state.
[ ] dynamiclly adding/removing DOM should fire change event
[ ] work with hidden template for array type field
[ ] add behaviour with parameters
[ ] jQuery object out of the scope of all parts may listen to state change of below parts some how
